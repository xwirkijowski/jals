# JALS / Just Another Link Shortener v2

A simple solution for shortening links built with React, Next.js and GraphQL with basic safety features. Initially designed and developed in 2021 as a personal challenge and to get some new experience.

I began work on a refactor in december 2024. Primary goal was to gain practical knowledge of current React (v19) and Next.js (v15) features, including the new App router. As a secondary goal, client application was to fully leverage TailwindCSS features and implement some subtle animations.

React and Next.js features used are listed in separate [api](./api/README.md) and [client](./client/README.md) `README.md` files.

> **See it in action!** Production demo of v1 available at [jals.wirkijowski.dev](https://jals.wirkijowski.dev/)

### Tech stack
- **Client**
  - **React** — frontend framework
  - **React Router** — navigation
  - **SCSS** — CSS preprocessor
  - **CSS Modules** — styling approach
  - **BEM** — class naming methodology
  - **Apollo Client** — communication with API
- **API server**
  - **Apollo Server** — GraphQL server
  - **Mongoose** — ORM interface for MongoDB

### Functionality
- Functional link shortening
- Link inspection using `+` as a modifier at the end of the URL
- Collected data included user's platform, if is mobile device and timestamp of click
- Users were redirected the moment a click is registered (positive response from API)
- If a link is flagged multiple times, users were warned about it and asked to confirm before proceeding with the redirect.
